# Image-Encryption-using-Chaotic-Cryptography
* Image encryption is nothing but the transmission of data in an unreadable format in which it can be read-only by those members who have specific knowledge, commonly referred to as a key. 

* Chaos technique is used to transmit the information securely or privately through the third-party. 

* The encryption process is processed by generating the chaotic number, permutation and diffusion keys. Permutation is carried out in two ways: pixel-level permutation and bit-level permutation. Both process strengthens the security of the cryptosystem. Bit-level permutation scrambles the image. Entropy is generated by the chaotic map which produces confusion and diffusion. Chaotic model is evaluated using three different mapping techniques they are Logistic, Sine and Chebyshev.
